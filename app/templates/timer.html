  <h3>Work with time, not against it.</h3>
  <p>For many people, time is an enemy. We race against the clock to finish assignments and meet deadlines. The Pomodoro Technique teaches you to work with time, instead of struggling against it. A revolutionary time management system, it is at once deceptively simple to learn and life-changing to use.</p>

  <h3>Eliminate Burnout</h3>
  <p>Essential to the Pomodoro Technique is the notion that taking short, scheduled breaks while working eliminates the “running on fumes” feeling you get when you’ve pushed yourself too hard. It’s impossible to over work when you stick to the system. You may end up taking fewer sick days, too!</p>

Becoming a Pomodoro Master involves creating an effective timetable, allowing you to truly enjoy your time off.</p>
